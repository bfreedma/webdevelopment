Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This website is supposed to be a concept of a virtual zoo where visiters can see and learn about unique animals all while staying at home. To get to each of the other pages my website has a bootstrap nav bar pasted to the top of each page. The backgrounds of my pages change on smaller screens.

## index
This is the main page of my website. This page features a table and gallery of images that use bootstrap's flexbox.

## giraffe.html
This page includes a list for different facts.

## monkey.html
This page has an embedded Youtube video and some images with captions that take advantage of bootstrap's grid model

## kangaroo.html
This page takes advantage of bootstrap's jumbotron to link information to a different website.

## styles.scss
This is my website's stylesheet that I import into the rest of my website's pages. This stylesheet has a variety of properties such as variables, nesting, and inheritance.
