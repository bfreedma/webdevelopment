## register.html
This is where a new user will be able to create a new account.

## search.html
This is where users will be able to search for a book of their choice.

This file is the general layout template that each of my webpages extends inside.

## style.css

## import.py
This python file creates 3 tables, the user table, the review table, and the books table. Then once the tables are made, this program will then import the data from the books.csv file into the online heroku-postgresql database.
